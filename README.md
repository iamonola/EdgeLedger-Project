# EdgeLedger-Project
Single Page Website
This is a single page project with common classes used through out the various sections across the page.

This project is a fully responsive single page website with a simple stucture and responsive across devices ranging from Desktop, iPad and Smartphone screens.
You'll find that through out this project are comments to help understand better from the index.html, style sheets and JS there in.


In order to achieve responsiveness, media queries were employed. Icon classes were gotten from fontawesome.com.

Unlike in the Hotel project where I used float, here I used flex as its easier to use compared to float where you'll have to clear folats and also every adjustment made on the page affects your float and also it doesn't allow full responsiveness.


#SmoothScrolling was introduced<!-- JQueary CDN -->, Sticky menu was also added to make the navbar at the top stick when scrolling, also added google map
